To quickly get up to speed, we suggest you take a look at these four sections:
Day view - general information about how ManicTime presents recorded data
Tagging - how to use recorded data to keep track of your time
Screenshots - how to use screenshots for tagging
Timesheet - how to generate timesheet reports based on your tags
Then we suggest you look at the following topics:
Advanced search - how to use Advanced search for searching, tagging, deleting data
Untagged statistics - how to see which days are still not fully tagged
Autotagging - how to use autotags instead of tags or for easier manual tagging
This should give you enough information for start. There is a lot more written in the help topics, but if you still have questions email us at support@manictime.com.
